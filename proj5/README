440 - Operating Systems
Project 5

oopsies pls dnt read this lmao

- a string text written to /dev/adder is interpreted as representing integer(s)
	> a string may contain several integers separated by white space
	> any characters that are not part of an integer or white space should raise an error

- a read from /dev/adder returns a single string reprenting the sum of the ints written to /dev/adder since instantiated

- may generate other error conditions (should be indicated in some way)

driver should do something about multiple pending operations on the same device:
	= Minimal Option: allow at most one reader and one writer to open the driver at the same time
		*extra open beyond 1 read and 1 write should fail with error code
		*value returned by read should be sum as of the time the driver was opened for that read

	= Advanced Option: allow multiple opens for reading and write. 
		*results should be consistent with model that the simultaneous pending operations completed in some order
		*each read returns a value, the sum of all values whose writes have completed when the read started and some values whose writes have not yet completed before the read open call


---- Project Milestones ----

1) Instantiate your VM

2) Compile and Run example kernel modules from class
	- examples from class, hellomod, and chardev are in separate folders below ~ec4440/.....??? in the VM

3) Create the adder device

4) Demonstrate the adder device at the oral exam
